# FYP
 Source code used to generate results and plots for the FYP

## Structure of the project
In this project you will find code that was used for each material, consiting of: 
1. VC-relax
    * Including jmol display of the crystal
2. Convergence Testing
    * ecutwfc (Kinetic energy cutoff for wavefunctions, in Ry units)
    * K-points 
    * Lattice Constant
3. Kpath determined using Xcrysden
4. Bands Calculation
5. Density of States (DOS) Calculation

Please refer to my final report where you will find more details on the computational methods.
